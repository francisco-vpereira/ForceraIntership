%I'd like to start by thanking my supervisors and professors, Dr. Armandina Lima Lopes and Dr. João Pedro Araújo, for allowing me to join their group, where I felt welcome since day one and learned more that I could have imagined. For all the calm and kind words too, even in distressful moments. My heartfelt gratitude for all incredible opportunities you've provided me, which have contributed a great deal to my growth professionally and as a person. 

%For providing me with much guidance, great discussions, and always being available to answer any questions, I am very grateful to Drs. Estelina Lora da Silva, Neenu Lekshmi, and Pedro Rocha-Rodrigues. Only with their constant help and expertise could this project focus on such a varied set of techniques.

%To my dear friend Pedro Sousa, with whom I had the fortune to closely work with, for all the discussions, shared adventures and stressful moments, for helping me think clearly during restless occasions, and keeping me motivated over the past two years. A thank you to the rest of \textit{Sueca Italiana} as well, my group of great friends with whom I share many incredible memories, which I shall cherish as some of the highest points of my student life.

%A thank you to all of the ISOLDE/CERN team for making our PAC experiments possible, especially to Dr. João Guilherme Correia, who also took the time to explain in detail, and great excitement, how the technique and the lab equipment worked. To Helena M. Petrilli, Lucy V. C. Assali, Michel L. Marcondes, and Samuel S. dos Santos, of the University of São Paulo, for providing great discussions on the DFT calculations. To Drs. Rui Vilarinho and Mariana M. Gomes, for helping us with the Raman Spectroscopy measurements.
