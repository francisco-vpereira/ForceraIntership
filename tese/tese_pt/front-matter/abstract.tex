The need to add more transparency and reliability in the detection of possible cases of fraud and corruption in public procurement processes motivated the development of a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating public contracts.

This thesis develops and implements an automated system for applying \textit{red flags}, or indicators, defined by the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP), in accordance with the legislation applied by the Public Contracts Code (CCP), with the purpose of identify possible irregularities in public procurement actions.

Additionally, the process is automated using the \textit{cloud} service Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure that contract analysis is carried out daily, monitoring the entry of new contracts into a PostgreSQL database.

From the research carried out, it was concluded that the system is capable of identifying and flagging public contracts that do not fully consider the criteria defined by the CCP, making it an effective tool in the management and supervision of public contracts.
